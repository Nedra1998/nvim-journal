2. CONFIGURATION                                  *nvim-journal-configuration*

You must run the setup() function to initialize nvim-journal.

setup() function takes one optional argument: configuration table. If omitted
nvim-journal will be initialized with default configuration.

Subsequent calls to setup will replace the previous configuration.

>
    require('nvim-journal').setup({
      default = nil,
      journals = {
        ["journal"] = {
          path = "~/Documents/Journal",
          frequency = "daily",
          filename = "%Y-%m-%d.md",
          template = {
            create = "# %a %b %d %T %Y\n\n",
            update = "## %H:%M\n\n",
          },
        },
    })
<

Here is a list of the options available in the setup call:

*nvim-journal.default*
Set the default journal to open if no other journal is specified/found.
  Type: `string`, Default: `nil`

*nvim-journal.journals*
A table of journal configurations, where the key is the name of the journal,
and the value is the configuration for that journal.

    *nvim-journal.journals.path*
    Directory that the journal files should be created in. All files for the
    journal will be created within this directory, and this is the directory
    that is used when searching for journals within the current working
    directory.
      Type: `string`

    *nvim-journal.journals.frequency*
    Configure the frequency for the journal. Either set as a predefined
    string, or as a custom function. Can be one of `daily`, `weekly`,
    `monthly`, `yearly` or a function.
      Type: `string` or `function(date, offset)`

      The function is passed the entry date for journal, and an offset for
      which entry to open. The offset is in terms of the full frequency (e.g.
      the offset for a daily journal will be provided in terms of days, and
      the offset for a weekly journal will be provided in terms of weeks).
      e.g. >
        frequency = function(current, offset)
          current:setday(1)
          return current:addmonths(offset)
        end
<

    *nvim-journal.journals.filename*
    The template for the filename for a new journal entry. This argument
    supports date format strings, and will be formatted with the entry date.
      Type: `string`

    *nvim-journal.journals.template*
    Add optional templates for the journal, which will automatically be added
    to the journal entries as they are created/updated.
      Type: `Table`, Default: `{}`

        *nvim-journal.journals.template.create*
        A template for the journal entry, this will only be added once when the
        file is initially created. The string value supports date format strings
        and is formatted with the journal entry date.
          Type: `string` or `function(date)`, Default: `nil`

          The function is passed the journal entry date, and is expected to
          return a string to insert into the buffer.

        *nvim-journal.journals.template.update*
        This template is added to the end of the file every time the journal
        is opened (if it is not already present in the file). The string
        supports date format strings, and is formatted with the current date
        time.
          Type: `string` or `function(date)`, Default: `nil`

          The function is passed the current date, and is expected to
          return a string to append to the buffer.

3. COMMANDS                                            *nvim-journal-commands*

:JournalOpen {date}
:JournalOpen {date} {journal}

    Open a journal at a given specifc date. Optionally specify a journal to
    open. Given a specific date, it will find the active entry for the
    journal's frequency at that date and open that entry.

    If no journal is specified, it will first check for any journals within
    the current directory, and then will attempt to open the configured
    default journal.

:JournalCurrent
:JournalCurrent {journal}

    Open the currently active entry for a journal. Optionally specify a
    journal to open.

    If no journal is specified, it will first check for any journals within
    the current directory, and then will attempt to open the configured
    default journal.

:JournalNext
:JournalNext {journal}

    Open the next entry for a journal. Optionally specify a journal to open.
    The "next entry" is the entry that will follow the currently active entry.
    This is dependent on the frequency of the journal (e.g. for a daily
    journal, the next entry will be for tomorrow. And for a weekly journal the
    next entry will be for next week).

    If no journal is specified, it will first check for any journals within
    the current directory, and then will attempt to open the configured
    default journal.

:JournalPrevious
:JournalPrevious {journal}

    Open the previous entry for a journal. Optionally specify a journal to
    open. The "previous entry" is the entry that preceeded the currently active
    entry. This is dependent on the frequency of the journal (e.g. for a daily
    journal, the previous entry will be for yesterday. And for a weekly journal the
    previous entry will be for last week).

    If no journal is specified, it will first check for any journals within
    the current directory, and then will attempt to open the configured
    default journal.
